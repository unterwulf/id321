<span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span>Status of this document
<span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span>   This document is an informal standard and replaces the ID3v2.3.0
<span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span>   standard [ID3v2]. A formal standard will use another revision number
<span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span>   even if the content is identical to document. The contents in this
<span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span>   document may change for clarifications but never for added or altered
<span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span>   functionallity.

<span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span>Abstract
<span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span>   This document describes the frames natively supported by ID3v2.4.0,
<span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span>   which is a revised version of the ID3v2 informal standard [ID3v2.3.0]
<span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span>   version 2.3.0. The ID3v2 offers a flexible way of storing audio meta
<span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span>   information within audio file itself. The information may be
<span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span>   technical information, such as equalisation curves, as well as title,
<span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span>   performer, copyright etc.
<span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span>   ID3v2.4.0 is meant to be as close as possible to ID3v2.3.0 in order
<span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span>   to allow for implementations to be revised as easily as possible.

<span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span>   Text within "" is a text string exactly as it appears in a tag.
<span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span>   Numbers preceded with $ are hexadecimal and numbers preceded with %
<span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span>   are binary. $xx is used to indicate a byte with unknown content. %x
<span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span>   is used to indicate a bit with unknown content. The most significant
<span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span>   bit (MSB) of a byte is called 'bit 7' and the least significant bit
<span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span>   (LSB) is called 'bit 0'.
<span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-94"></span>   A tag is the whole tag described the ID3v2 main structure document
<span class="anchor" id="line-95"></span>   [ID3v2-strct]. A frame is a block of information in the tag. The tag
<span class="anchor" id="line-96"></span>   consists of a header, frames and optional padding. A field is a piece
<span class="anchor" id="line-97"></span>   of information; one value, a string etc. A numeric string is a string
<span class="anchor" id="line-98"></span>   that consists of the characters "0123456789" only.
<span class="anchor" id="line-99"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-100"></span>   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
<span class="anchor" id="line-101"></span>   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
<span class="anchor" id="line-102"></span>   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].

<span class="anchor" id="line-230"></span>4.1.   Unique file identifier
<span class="anchor" id="line-231"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-232"></span>   This frame's purpose is to be able to identify the audio file in a
<span class="anchor" id="line-233"></span>   database, that may provide more information relevant to the content.
<span class="anchor" id="line-234"></span>   Since standardisation of such a database is beyond this document, all
<span class="anchor" id="line-235"></span>   UFID frames begin with an 'owner identifier' field. It is a null-
<span class="anchor" id="line-236"></span>   terminated string with a URL [URL] containing an email address, or a
<span class="anchor" id="line-237"></span>   link to a location where an email address can be found, that belongs
<span class="anchor" id="line-238"></span>   to the organisation responsible for this specific database
<span class="anchor" id="line-239"></span>   implementation. Questions regarding the database should be sent to
<span class="anchor" id="line-240"></span>   the indicated email address. The URL should not be used for the
<span class="anchor" id="line-241"></span>   actual database queries. The string
<span class="anchor" id="line-242"></span>   "http://www.id3.org/dummy/ufid.html" should be used for tests. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-243"></span>   'Owner identifier' must be non-empty (more than just a termination).
<span class="anchor" id="line-244"></span>   The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by the actual identifier,
<span class="anchor" id="line-245"></span>   which may be up to 64 bytes. There may be more than one "UFID" frame
<span class="anchor" id="line-246"></span>   in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner identifier'.
<span class="anchor" id="line-247"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-248"></span>     &lt;Header for 'Unique file identifier', ID: "UFID"&gt;

<span class="anchor" id="line-253"></span>4.2.   Text information frames
<span class="anchor" id="line-254"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-255"></span>   The text information frames are often the most important frames,
<span class="anchor" id="line-256"></span>   containing information like artist, album and more. There may only be
<span class="anchor" id="line-257"></span>   one text information frame of its kind in an tag. All text
<span class="anchor" id="line-258"></span>   information frames supports multiple strings, stored as a null
<span class="anchor" id="line-259"></span>   separated list, where null is reperesented by the termination code
<span class="anchor" id="line-260"></span>   for the charater encoding. All text frame identifiers begin with "T".
<span class="anchor" id="line-261"></span>   Only text frame identifiers begin with "T", with the exception of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-262"></span>   "TXXX" frame. All the text information frames have the following
<span class="anchor" id="line-263"></span>   format:
<span class="anchor" id="line-264"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-265"></span>     &lt;Header for 'Text information frame', ID: "T000" - "TZZZ",

<span class="anchor" id="line-272"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-273"></span>  TIT1
<span class="anchor" id="line-274"></span>   The 'Content group description' frame is used if the sound belongs to
<span class="anchor" id="line-275"></span>   a larger category of sounds/music. For example, classical music is
<span class="anchor" id="line-276"></span>   often sorted in different musical sections (e.g. "Piano Concerto",
<span class="anchor" id="line-277"></span>   "Weather - Hurricane").
<span class="anchor" id="line-278"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-279"></span>  TIT2
<span class="anchor" id="line-280"></span>   The 'Title/Songname/Content description' frame is the actual name of
<span class="anchor" id="line-281"></span>   the piece (e.g. "Adagio", "Hurricane Donna").
<span class="anchor" id="line-282"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-283"></span>  TIT3
<span class="anchor" id="line-284"></span>   The 'Subtitle/Description refinement' frame is used for information
<span class="anchor" id="line-285"></span>   directly related to the contents title (e.g. "Op. 16" or "Performed
<span class="anchor" id="line-286"></span>   live at Wembley").
<span class="anchor" id="line-287"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-288"></span>  TALB
<span class="anchor" id="line-289"></span>   The 'Album/Movie/Show title' frame is intended for the title of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-290"></span>   recording (or source of sound) from which the audio in the file is
<span class="anchor" id="line-291"></span>   taken.
<span class="anchor" id="line-292"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-293"></span>  TOAL
<span class="anchor" id="line-294"></span>   The 'Original album/movie/show title' frame is intended for the title
<span class="anchor" id="line-295"></span>   of the original recording (or source of sound), if for example the
<span class="anchor" id="line-296"></span>   music in the file should be a cover of a previously released song.
<span class="anchor" id="line-297"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-298"></span>  TRCK
<span class="anchor" id="line-299"></span>   The 'Track number/Position in set' frame is a numeric string
<span class="anchor" id="line-300"></span>   containing the order number of the audio-file on its original
<span class="anchor" id="line-301"></span>   recording. This MAY be extended with a "/" character and a numeric
<span class="anchor" id="line-302"></span>   string containing the total number of tracks/elements on the original
<span class="anchor" id="line-303"></span>   recording. E.g. "4/9".
<span class="anchor" id="line-304"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-305"></span>  TPOS
<span class="anchor" id="line-306"></span>   The 'Part of a set' frame is a numeric string that describes which
<span class="anchor" id="line-307"></span>   part of a set the audio came from. This frame is used if the source
<span class="anchor" id="line-308"></span>   described in the "TALB" frame is divided into several mediums, e.g. a
<span class="anchor" id="line-309"></span>   double CD. The value MAY be extended with a "/" character and a
<span class="anchor" id="line-310"></span>   numeric string containing the total number of parts in the set. E.g.
<span class="anchor" id="line-311"></span>   "1/2".
<span class="anchor" id="line-312"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-313"></span>  TSST
<span class="anchor" id="line-314"></span>   The 'Set subtitle' frame is intended for the subtitle of the part of

<span class="anchor" id="line-362"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-363"></span>  TIPL
<span class="anchor" id="line-364"></span>   The 'Involved people list' is very similar to the musician credits
<span class="anchor" id="line-365"></span>   list, but maps between functions, like producer, and names.

<span class="anchor" id="line-391"></span>   "o" only.
<span class="anchor" id="line-392"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-393"></span>  TLAN
<span class="anchor" id="line-394"></span>   The 'Language' frame should contain the languages of the text or
<span class="anchor" id="line-395"></span>   lyrics spoken or sung in the audio. The language is represented with
<span class="anchor" id="line-396"></span>   three characters according to ISO-639-2 [ISO-639-2]. If more than one
<span class="anchor" id="line-397"></span>   language is used in the text their language codes should follow
<span class="anchor" id="line-398"></span>   according to the amount of their usage, e.g. "eng" $00 "sve" $00.
<span class="anchor" id="line-399"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-400"></span>  TCON
<span class="anchor" id="line-401"></span>   The 'Content type', which ID3v1 was stored as a one byte numeric
<span class="anchor" id="line-402"></span>   value only, is now a string. You may use one or several of the ID3v1
<span class="anchor" id="line-403"></span>   types as numerical strings, or, since the category list would be
<span class="anchor" id="line-404"></span>   impossible to maintain with accurate and up to date categories,
<span class="anchor" id="line-405"></span>   define your own. Example: "21" $00 "Eurodisco" $00
<span class="anchor" id="line-406"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-407"></span>   You may also use any of the following keywords:

<span class="anchor" id="line-427"></span>   used in a similar way to the predefined types in the "TMED" frame,
<span class="anchor" id="line-428"></span>   but without parentheses. If this frame is not present audio type is
<span class="anchor" id="line-429"></span>   assumed to be "MPG".
<span class="anchor" id="line-430"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-431"></span>  TMED
<span class="anchor" id="line-432"></span>   The 'Media type' frame describes from which media the sound

<span class="anchor" id="line-784"></span>   Terminating the start events such as "intro start" is OPTIONAL. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-785"></span>   'Not predefined synch's ($E0-EF) are for user events. You might want
<span class="anchor" id="line-786"></span>   to synchronise your music to something, like setting off an explosion
<span class="anchor" id="line-787"></span>   on-stage, activating a screensaver etc.
<span class="anchor" id="line-788"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-789"></span>   There may only be one "ETCO" frame in each tag.
<span class="anchor" id="line-790"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-791"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-792"></span>4.6.   MPEG location lookup table
<span class="anchor" id="line-793"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-794"></span>   To increase performance and accuracy of jumps within a MPEG [MPEG]
<span class="anchor" id="line-795"></span>   audio file, frames with time codes in different locations in the file
<span class="anchor" id="line-796"></span>   might be useful. This ID3v2 frame includes references that the
<span class="anchor" id="line-797"></span>   software can use to calculate positions in the file. After the frame
<span class="anchor" id="line-798"></span>   header follows a descriptor of how much the 'frame counter' should be
<span class="anchor" id="line-799"></span>   increased for every reference. If this value is two then the first
<span class="anchor" id="line-800"></span>   reference points out the second frame, the 2nd reference the 4th
<span class="anchor" id="line-801"></span>   frame, the 3rd reference the 6th frame etc. In a similar way the
<span class="anchor" id="line-802"></span>   'bytes between reference' and 'milliseconds between reference' points
<span class="anchor" id="line-803"></span>   out bytes and milliseconds respectively.
<span class="anchor" id="line-804"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-805"></span>   Each reference consists of two parts; a certain number of bits, as
<span class="anchor" id="line-806"></span>   defined in 'bits for bytes deviation', that describes the difference
<span class="anchor" id="line-807"></span>   between what is said in 'bytes between reference' and the reality and
<span class="anchor" id="line-808"></span>   a certain number of bits, as defined in 'bits for milliseconds
<span class="anchor" id="line-809"></span>   deviation', that describes the difference between what is said in
<span class="anchor" id="line-810"></span>   'milliseconds between reference' and the reality. The number of bits
<span class="anchor" id="line-811"></span>   in every reference, i.e. 'bits for bytes deviation'+'bits for
<span class="anchor" id="line-812"></span>   milliseconds deviation', must be a multiple of four. There may only
<span class="anchor" id="line-813"></span>   be one "MLLT" frame in each tag.
<span class="anchor" id="line-814"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-815"></span>     &lt;Header for 'Location lookup table', ID: "MLLT"&gt;

<span class="anchor" id="line-821"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-822"></span>   Then for every reference the following data is included;
<span class="anchor" id="line-823"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-824"></span>     Deviation in bytes         %xxx....
<span class="anchor" id="line-825"></span>     Deviation in milliseconds  %xxx....

<span class="anchor" id="line-827"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-828"></span>4.7.   Synchronised tempo codes
<span class="anchor" id="line-829"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-830"></span>   For a more accurate description of the tempo of a musical piece, this
<span class="anchor" id="line-831"></span>   frame might be used. After the header follows one byte describing
<span class="anchor" id="line-832"></span>   which time stamp format should be used. Then follows one or more
<span class="anchor" id="line-833"></span>   tempo codes. Each tempo code consists of one tempo part and one time
<span class="anchor" id="line-834"></span>   part. The tempo is in BPM described with one or two bytes. If the
<span class="anchor" id="line-835"></span>   first byte has the value $FF, one more byte follows, which is added
<span class="anchor" id="line-836"></span>   to the first giving a range from 2 - 510 BPM, since $00 and $01 is
<span class="anchor" id="line-837"></span>   reserved. $00 is used to describe a beat-free time period, which is
<span class="anchor" id="line-838"></span>   not the same as a music-free time period. $01 is used to indicate one
<span class="anchor" id="line-839"></span>   single beat-stroke followed by a beat-free period.
<span class="anchor" id="line-840"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-841"></span>   The tempo descriptor is followed by a time stamp. Every time the
<span class="anchor" id="line-842"></span>   tempo in the music changes, a tempo descriptor may indicate this for
<span class="anchor" id="line-843"></span>   the player. All tempo descriptors MUST be sorted in chronological
<span class="anchor" id="line-844"></span>   order. The first beat-stroke in a time-period is at the same time as
<span class="anchor" id="line-845"></span>   the beat description occurs. There may only be one "SYTC" frame in
<span class="anchor" id="line-846"></span>   each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-851"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-852"></span>   Where time stamp format is:
<span class="anchor" id="line-853"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-854"></span>     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
<span class="anchor" id="line-855"></span>     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
<span class="anchor" id="line-856"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-857"></span>   Absolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
<span class="anchor" id="line-858"></span>   beginning of the file.
<span class="anchor" id="line-859"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-860"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-861"></span>4.8.   Unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription
<span class="anchor" id="line-862"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-863"></span>   This frame contains the lyrics of the song or a text transcription of
<span class="anchor" id="line-864"></span>   other vocal activities. The head includes an encoding descriptor and
<span class="anchor" id="line-865"></span>   a content descriptor. The body consists of the actual text. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-866"></span>   'Content descriptor' is a terminated string. If no descriptor is
<span class="anchor" id="line-867"></span>   entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only. Newline characters
<span class="anchor" id="line-868"></span>   are allowed in the text. There may be more than one 'Unsynchronised
<span class="anchor" id="line-869"></span>   lyrics/text transcription' frame in each tag, but only one with the
<span class="anchor" id="line-870"></span>   same language and content descriptor.

<span class="anchor" id="line-880"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-881"></span>   This is another way of incorporating the words, said or sung lyrics,
<span class="anchor" id="line-882"></span>   in the audio file as text, this time, however, in sync with the
<span class="anchor" id="line-883"></span>   audio. It might also be used to describing events e.g. occurring on a
<span class="anchor" id="line-884"></span>   stage or on the screen in sync with the audio. The header includes a
<span class="anchor" id="line-885"></span>   content descriptor, represented with as terminated text string. If no
<span class="anchor" id="line-886"></span>   descriptor is entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only.

<span class="anchor" id="line-899"></span>                   $04 is events (e.g. "Don Quijote enters the stage")
<span class="anchor" id="line-900"></span>                   $05 is chord (e.g. "Bb F Fsus")
<span class="anchor" id="line-901"></span>                   $06 is trivia/'pop up' information
<span class="anchor" id="line-902"></span>                   $07 is URLs to webpages
<span class="anchor" id="line-903"></span>                   $08 is URLs to images
<span class="anchor" id="line-904"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-905"></span>   Time stamp format:
<span class="anchor" id="line-906"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-907"></span>     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
<span class="anchor" id="line-908"></span>     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
<span class="anchor" id="line-909"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-910"></span>   Absolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
<span class="anchor" id="line-911"></span>   beginning of the file.
<span class="anchor" id="line-912"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-913"></span>   The text that follows the frame header differs from that of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-914"></span>   unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription in one major way. Each
<span class="anchor" id="line-915"></span>   syllable (or whatever size of text is considered to be convenient by
<span class="anchor" id="line-916"></span>   the encoder) is a null terminated string followed by a time stamp
<span class="anchor" id="line-917"></span>   denoting where in the sound file it belongs. Each sync thus has the
<span class="anchor" id="line-918"></span>   following structure:
<span class="anchor" id="line-919"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-920"></span>     Terminated text to be synced (typically a syllable)
<span class="anchor" id="line-921"></span>     Sync identifier (terminator to above string)   $00 (00)
<span class="anchor" id="line-922"></span>     Time stamp                                     $xx (xx ...)
<span class="anchor" id="line-923"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-924"></span>   The 'time stamp' is set to zero or the whole sync is omitted if
<span class="anchor" id="line-925"></span>   located directly at the beginning of the sound. All time stamps
<span class="anchor" id="line-926"></span>   should be sorted in chronological order. The sync can be considered
<span class="anchor" id="line-927"></span>   as a validator of the subsequent string.
<span class="anchor" id="line-928"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-929"></span>   Newline characters are allowed in all "SYLT" frames and MUST be used
<span class="anchor" id="line-930"></span>   after every entry (name, event etc.) in a frame with the content type
<span class="anchor" id="line-931"></span>   $03 - $04.
<span class="anchor" id="line-932"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-933"></span>   A few considerations regarding whitespace characters: Whitespace
<span class="anchor" id="line-934"></span>   separating words should mark the beginning of a new word, thus
<span class="anchor" id="line-935"></span>   occurring in front of the first syllable of a new word. This is also
<span class="anchor" id="line-936"></span>   valid for new line characters. A syllable followed by a comma should
<span class="anchor" id="line-937"></span>   not be broken apart with a sync (both the syllable and the comma
<span class="anchor" id="line-938"></span>   should be before the sync).
<span class="anchor" id="line-939"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-940"></span>   An example: The "USLT" passage
<span class="anchor" id="line-941"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-942"></span>     "Strangers in the night" $0A "Exchanging glances"
<span class="anchor" id="line-943"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-944"></span>   would be "SYLT" encoded as:
<span class="anchor" id="line-945"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-946"></span>     "Strang" $00 xx xx "ers" $00 xx xx " in" $00 xx xx " the" $00 xx xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-947"></span>     " night" $00 xx xx 0A "Ex" $00 xx xx "chang" $00 xx xx "ing" $00 xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-948"></span>     xx "glan" $00 xx xx "ces" $00 xx xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-949"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-950"></span>   There may be more than one "SYLT" frame in each tag, but only one
<span class="anchor" id="line-951"></span>   with the same language and content descriptor.
<span class="anchor" id="line-952"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-953"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-954"></span>4.10.   Comments
<span class="anchor" id="line-955"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-956"></span>   This frame is intended for any kind of full text information that
<span class="anchor" id="line-957"></span>   does not fit in any other frame. It consists of a frame header
<span class="anchor" id="line-958"></span>   followed by encoding, language and content descriptors and is ended
<span class="anchor" id="line-959"></span>   with the actual comment as a text string. Newline characters are
<span class="anchor" id="line-960"></span>   allowed in the comment text string. There may be more than one
<span class="anchor" id="line-961"></span>   comment frame in each tag, but only one with the same language and
<span class="anchor" id="line-962"></span>   content descriptor.

<span class="anchor" id="line-971"></span>4.11.   Relative volume adjustment (2)
<span class="anchor" id="line-972"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-973"></span>   This is a more subjective frame than the previous ones. It allows the
<span class="anchor" id="line-974"></span>   user to say how much he wants to increase/decrease the volume on each
<span class="anchor" id="line-975"></span>   channel when the file is played. The purpose is to be able to align
<span class="anchor" id="line-976"></span>   all files to a reference volume, so that you don't have to change the
<span class="anchor" id="line-977"></span>   volume constantly. This frame may also be used to balance adjust the
<span class="anchor" id="line-978"></span>   audio. The volume adjustment is encoded as a fixed point decibel
<span class="anchor" id="line-979"></span>   value, 16 bit signed integer representing (adjustment*512), giving
<span class="anchor" id="line-980"></span>   +/- 64 dB with a precision of 0.001953125 dB. E.g. +2 dB is stored as
<span class="anchor" id="line-981"></span>   $04 00 and -2 dB is $FC 00. There may be more than one "RVA2" frame
<span class="anchor" id="line-982"></span>   in each tag, but only one with the same identification string.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1009"></span>   padded to whole bytes, setting the most significant bits to zero.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1012"></span>4.12.   Equalisation (2)
<span class="anchor" id="line-1013"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1014"></span>   This is another subjective, alignment frame. It allows the user to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1015"></span>   predefine an equalisation curve within the audio file. There may be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1016"></span>   more than one "EQU2" frame in each tag, but only one with the same
<span class="anchor" id="line-1017"></span>   identification string.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1022"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1023"></span>   The 'interpolation method' describes which method is preferred when
<span class="anchor" id="line-1024"></span>   an interpolation between the adjustment point that follows. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1025"></span>   following methods are currently defined:
<span class="anchor" id="line-1026"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1027"></span>     $00  Band
<span class="anchor" id="line-1028"></span>          No interpolation is made. A jump from one adjustment level to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1029"></span>          another occurs in the middle between two adjustment points.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1030"></span>     $01  Linear
<span class="anchor" id="line-1031"></span>          Interpolation between adjustment points is linear.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1032"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1033"></span>   The 'identification' string is used to identify the situation and/or
<span class="anchor" id="line-1034"></span>   device where this adjustment should apply. The following is then
<span class="anchor" id="line-1035"></span>   repeated for every adjustment point
<span class="anchor" id="line-1036"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1037"></span>     Frequency          $xx xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-1038"></span>     Volume adjustment  $xx xx
<span class="anchor" id="line-1039"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1040"></span>   The frequency is stored in units of 1/2 Hz, giving it a range from 0
<span class="anchor" id="line-1041"></span>   to 32767 Hz.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1042"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1043"></span>   The volume adjustment is encoded as a fixed point decibel value, 16
<span class="anchor" id="line-1044"></span>   bit signed integer representing (adjustment*512), giving +/- 64 dB
<span class="anchor" id="line-1045"></span>   with a precision of 0.001953125 dB. E.g. +2 dB is stored as $04 00
<span class="anchor" id="line-1046"></span>   and -2 dB is $FC 00.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1047"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1048"></span>   Adjustment points should be ordered by frequency and one frequency
<span class="anchor" id="line-1049"></span>   should only be described once in the frame.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1050"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1051"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1052"></span>4.13.   Reverb
<span class="anchor" id="line-1053"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1054"></span>   Yet another subjective frame, with which you can adjust echoes of
<span class="anchor" id="line-1055"></span>   different kinds. Reverb left/right is the delay between every bounce
<span class="anchor" id="line-1056"></span>   in ms. Reverb bounces left/right is the number of bounces that should
<span class="anchor" id="line-1057"></span>   be made. $FF equals an infinite number of bounces. Feedback is the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1058"></span>   amount of volume that should be returned to the next echo bounce. $00
<span class="anchor" id="line-1059"></span>   is 0%, $FF is 100%. If this value were $7F, there would be 50% volume
<span class="anchor" id="line-1060"></span>   reduction on the first bounce, 50% of that on the second and so on.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1061"></span>   Left to left means the sound from the left bounce to be played in the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1062"></span>   left speaker, while left to right means sound from the left bounce to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1063"></span>   be played in the right speaker.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1064"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1065"></span>   'Premix left to right' is the amount of left sound to be mixed in the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1066"></span>   right before any reverb is applied, where $00 id 0% and $FF is 100%.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1067"></span>   'Premix right to left' does the same thing, but right to left.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1068"></span>   Setting both premix to $FF would result in a mono output (if the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1069"></span>   reverb is applied symmetric). There may only be one "RVRB" frame in
<span class="anchor" id="line-1070"></span>   each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1086"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1087"></span>   This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1088"></span>   Image format is the MIME type and subtype [MIME] for the image. In
<span class="anchor" id="line-1089"></span>   the event that the MIME media type name is omitted, "image/" will be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1090"></span>   implied. The "image/png" [PNG] or "image/jpeg" [JFIF] picture format
<span class="anchor" id="line-1091"></span>   should be used when interoperability is wanted. Description is a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1092"></span>   short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
<span class="anchor" id="line-1093"></span>   text string. There may be several pictures attached to one file, each
<span class="anchor" id="line-1094"></span>   in their individual "APIC" frame, but only one with the same content
<span class="anchor" id="line-1095"></span>   descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture type
<span class="anchor" id="line-1096"></span>   declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1097"></span>   possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'MIME
<span class="anchor" id="line-1098"></span>   type' "--&gt;" and having a complete URL [URL] instead of picture data.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1099"></span>   The use of linked files should however be used sparingly since there
<span class="anchor" id="line-1100"></span>   is the risk of separation of files.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1134"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1135"></span>   In this frame any type of file can be encapsulated. After the header,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1136"></span>   'Frame size' and 'Encoding' follows 'MIME type' [MIME] represented as
<span class="anchor" id="line-1137"></span>   as a terminated string encoded with ISO 8859-1 [ISO-8859-1]. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1138"></span>   filename is case sensitive and is encoded as 'Encoding'. Then follows
<span class="anchor" id="line-1139"></span>   a content description as terminated string, encoded as 'Encoding'.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1140"></span>   The last thing in the frame is the actual object. The first two
<span class="anchor" id="line-1141"></span>   strings may be omitted, leaving only their terminations. MIME type is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1142"></span>   always an ISO-8859-1 text string. There may be more than one "GEOB"
<span class="anchor" id="line-1143"></span>   frame in each tag, but only one with the same content descriptor.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1154"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1155"></span>   This is simply a counter of the number of times a file has been
<span class="anchor" id="line-1156"></span>   played. The value is increased by one every time the file begins to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1157"></span>   play. There may only be one "PCNT" frame in each tag. When the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1158"></span>   counter reaches all one's, one byte is inserted in front of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1159"></span>   counter thus making the counter eight bits bigger.  The counter must
<span class="anchor" id="line-1160"></span>   be at least 32-bits long to begin with.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1167"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1168"></span>   The purpose of this frame is to specify how good an audio file is.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1169"></span>   Many interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1170"></span>   playlist that features better audio files more often than others or
<span class="anchor" id="line-1171"></span>   it could be used to profile a person's taste and find other 'good'
<span class="anchor" id="line-1172"></span>   files by comparing people's profiles. The frame contains the email
<span class="anchor" id="line-1173"></span>   address to the user, one rating byte and a four byte play counter,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1174"></span>   intended to be increased with one for every time the file is played.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1175"></span>   The email is a terminated string. The rating is 1-255 where 1 is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1176"></span>   worst and 255 is best. 0 is unknown. If no personal counter is wanted
<span class="anchor" id="line-1177"></span>   it may be omitted. When the counter reaches all one's, one byte is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1178"></span>   inserted in front of the counter thus making the counter eight bits
<span class="anchor" id="line-1179"></span>   bigger in the same away as the play counter ("PCNT"). There may be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1180"></span>   more than one "POPM" frame in each tag, but only one with the same
<span class="anchor" id="line-1181"></span>   email address.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1189"></span>4.18.   Recommended buffer size
<span class="anchor" id="line-1190"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1191"></span>   Sometimes the server from which an audio file is streamed is aware of
<span class="anchor" id="line-1192"></span>   transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1193"></span>   audio stream. In these cases, the size of the buffer can be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1194"></span>   recommended by the server using this frame. If the 'embedded info
<span class="anchor" id="line-1195"></span>   flag' is true (1) then this indicates that an ID3 tag with the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1196"></span>   maximum size described in 'Buffer size' may occur in the audio
<span class="anchor" id="line-1197"></span>   stream. In such case the tag should reside between two MPEG [MPEG]
<span class="anchor" id="line-1198"></span>   frames, if the audio is MPEG encoded. If the position of the next tag
<span class="anchor" id="line-1199"></span>   is known, 'offset to next tag' may be used. The offset is calculated
<span class="anchor" id="line-1200"></span>   from the end of tag in which this frame resides to the first byte of
<span class="anchor" id="line-1201"></span>   the header in the next. This field may be omitted. Embedded tags are
<span class="anchor" id="line-1202"></span>   generally not recommended since this could render unpredictable
<span class="anchor" id="line-1203"></span>   behaviour from present software/hardware.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1204"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1205"></span>   For applications like streaming audio it might be an idea to embed
<span class="anchor" id="line-1206"></span>   tags into the audio stream though. If the clients connects to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1207"></span>   individual connections like HTTP and there is a possibility to begin
<span class="anchor" id="line-1208"></span>   every transmission with a tag, then this tag should include a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1209"></span>   'recommended buffer size' frame. If the client is connected to a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1210"></span>   arbitrary point in the stream, such as radio or multicast, then the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1211"></span>   'recommended buffer size' frame SHOULD be included in every tag.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1212"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1213"></span>   The 'Buffer size' should be kept to a minimum. There may only be one
<span class="anchor" id="line-1214"></span>   "RBUF" frame in each tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1222"></span>4.19.   Audio encryption
<span class="anchor" id="line-1223"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1224"></span>   This frame indicates if the actual audio stream is encrypted, and by
<span class="anchor" id="line-1225"></span>   whom. Since standardisation of such encryption scheme is beyond this
<span class="anchor" id="line-1226"></span>   document, all "AENC" frames begin with a terminated string with a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1227"></span>   URL containing an email address, or a link to a location where an
<span class="anchor" id="line-1228"></span>   email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation
<span class="anchor" id="line-1229"></span>   responsible for this specific encrypted audio file. Questions
<span class="anchor" id="line-1230"></span>   regarding the encrypted audio should be sent to the email address
<span class="anchor" id="line-1231"></span>   specified. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame size' and the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1232"></span>   audio file indeed is encrypted, the whole file may be considered
<span class="anchor" id="line-1233"></span>   useless.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1234"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1235"></span>   After the 'Owner identifier', a pointer to an unencrypted part of the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1236"></span>   audio can be specified. The 'Preview start' and 'Preview length' is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1237"></span>   described in frames. If no part is unencrypted, these fields should
<span class="anchor" id="line-1238"></span>   be left zeroed. After the 'preview length' field follows optionally a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1239"></span>   data block required for decryption of the audio. There may be more
<span class="anchor" id="line-1240"></span>   than one "AENC" frames in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner
<span class="anchor" id="line-1241"></span>   identifier'.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1253"></span>   used to link information from another ID3v2 tag that might reside in
<span class="anchor" id="line-1254"></span>   another audio file or alone in a binary file. It is RECOMMENDED that
<span class="anchor" id="line-1255"></span>   this method is only used when the files are stored on a CD-ROM or
<span class="anchor" id="line-1256"></span>   other circumstances when the risk of file separation is low. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1257"></span>   frame contains a frame identifier, which is the frame that should be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1258"></span>   linked into this tag, a URL [URL] field, where a reference to the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1259"></span>   file where the frame is given, and additional ID data, if needed.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1260"></span>   Data should be retrieved from the first tag found in the file to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1261"></span>   which this link points. There may be more than one "LINK" frame in a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1262"></span>   tag, but only one with the same contents. A linked frame is to be
<span class="anchor" id="line-1263"></span>   considered as part of the tag and has the same restrictions as if it
<span class="anchor" id="line-1264"></span>   was a physical part of the tag (i.e. only one "RVRB" frame allowed,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1265"></span>   whether it's linked or not).

<span class="anchor" id="line-1291"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1292"></span>   This frame delivers information to the listener of how far into the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1293"></span>   audio stream he picked up; in effect, it states the time offset from
<span class="anchor" id="line-1294"></span>   the first frame in the stream. The frame layout is:

<span class="anchor" id="line-1306"></span>   i.e. the beginning of the next frame. If this frame is used in the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1307"></span>   beginning of a file the value is always 0. There may only be one

<span class="anchor" id="line-1312"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1313"></span>   This frame contains a brief description of the terms of use and
<span class="anchor" id="line-1314"></span>   ownership of the file. More detailed information concerning the legal
<span class="anchor" id="line-1315"></span>   terms might be available through the "WCOP" frame. Newlines are
<span class="anchor" id="line-1316"></span>   allowed in the text. There may be more than one 'Terms of use' frame
<span class="anchor" id="line-1317"></span>   in a tag, but only one with the same 'Language'.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1326"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1327"></span>   The ownership frame might be used as a reminder of a made transaction
<span class="anchor" id="line-1328"></span>   or, if signed, as proof. Note that the "USER" and "TOWN" frames are
<span class="anchor" id="line-1329"></span>   good to use in conjunction with this one. The frame begins, after the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1330"></span>   frame ID, size and encoding fields, with a 'price paid' field. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1331"></span>   first three characters of this field contains the currency used for
<span class="anchor" id="line-1332"></span>   the transaction, encoded according to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic
<span class="anchor" id="line-1333"></span>   currency code. Concatenated to this is the actual price paid, as a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1334"></span>   numerical string using "." as the decimal separator. Next is an 8
<span class="anchor" id="line-1335"></span>   character date string (YYYYMMDD) followed by a string with the name
<span class="anchor" id="line-1336"></span>   of the seller as the last field in the frame. There may only be one
<span class="anchor" id="line-1337"></span>   "OWNE" frame in a tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1347"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1348"></span>   This frame enables several competing offers in the same tag by
<span class="anchor" id="line-1349"></span>   bundling all needed information. That makes this frame rather complex
<span class="anchor" id="line-1350"></span>   but it's an easier solution than if one tries to achieve the same
<span class="anchor" id="line-1351"></span>   result with several frames. The frame begins, after the frame ID,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1352"></span>   size and encoding fields, with a price string field. A price is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1353"></span>   constructed by one three character currency code, encoded according
<span class="anchor" id="line-1354"></span>   to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic currency code, followed by a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1355"></span>   numerical value where "." is used as decimal separator. In the price
<span class="anchor" id="line-1356"></span>   string several prices may be concatenated, separated by a "/"
<span class="anchor" id="line-1357"></span>   character, but there may only be one currency of each type.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1358"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1359"></span>   The price string is followed by an 8 character date string in the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1360"></span>   format YYYYMMDD, describing for how long the price is valid. After
<span class="anchor" id="line-1361"></span>   that is a contact URL, with which the user can contact the seller,
<span class="anchor" id="line-1362"></span>   followed by a one byte 'received as' field. It describes how the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1363"></span>   audio is delivered when bought according to the following list:
<span class="anchor" id="line-1364"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1365"></span>        $00  Other
<span class="anchor" id="line-1366"></span>        $01  Standard CD album with other songs
<span class="anchor" id="line-1367"></span>        $02  Compressed audio on CD
<span class="anchor" id="line-1368"></span>        $03  File over the Internet
<span class="anchor" id="line-1369"></span>        $04  Stream over the Internet
<span class="anchor" id="line-1370"></span>        $05  As note sheets
<span class="anchor" id="line-1371"></span>        $06  As note sheets in a book with other sheets
<span class="anchor" id="line-1372"></span>        $07  Music on other media
<span class="anchor" id="line-1373"></span>        $08  Non-musical merchandise
<span class="anchor" id="line-1374"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1375"></span>   Next follows a terminated string with the name of the seller followed
<span class="anchor" id="line-1376"></span>   by a terminated string with a short description of the product. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1377"></span>   last thing is the ability to include a company logotype. The first of
<span class="anchor" id="line-1378"></span>   them is the 'Picture MIME type' field containing information about
<span class="anchor" id="line-1379"></span>   which picture format is used. In the event that the MIME media type
<span class="anchor" id="line-1380"></span>   name is omitted, "image/" will be implied. Currently only "image/png"
<span class="anchor" id="line-1381"></span>   and "image/jpeg" are allowed. This format string is followed by the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1382"></span>   binary picture data. This two last fields may be omitted if no
<span class="anchor" id="line-1383"></span>   picture is attached. There may be more than one 'commercial frame' in
<span class="anchor" id="line-1384"></span>   a tag, but no two may be identical.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1399"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1400"></span>   To identify with which method a frame has been encrypted the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1401"></span>   encryption method must be registered in the tag with this frame. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1402"></span>   'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
<span class="anchor" id="line-1403"></span>   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
<span class="anchor" id="line-1404"></span>   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
<span class="anchor" id="line-1405"></span>   for this specific encryption method. Questions regarding the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1406"></span>   encryption method should be sent to the indicated email address. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1407"></span>   'Method symbol' contains a value that is associated with this method
<span class="anchor" id="line-1408"></span>   throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are
<span class="anchor" id="line-1409"></span>   reserved. The 'Method symbol' may optionally be followed by
<span class="anchor" id="line-1410"></span>   encryption specific data. There may be several "ENCR" frames in a tag
<span class="anchor" id="line-1411"></span>   but only one containing the same symbol and only one containing the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1412"></span>   same owner identifier. The method must be used somewhere in the tag.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1413"></span>   See the description of the frame encryption flag in the ID3v2

<span class="anchor" id="line-1423"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1424"></span>   This frame enables grouping of otherwise unrelated frames. This can
<span class="anchor" id="line-1425"></span>   be used when some frames are to be signed. To identify which frames
<span class="anchor" id="line-1426"></span>   belongs to a set of frames a group identifier must be registered in
<span class="anchor" id="line-1427"></span>   the tag with this frame. The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated
<span class="anchor" id="line-1428"></span>   string with a URL [URL] containing an email address, or a link to a
<span class="anchor" id="line-1429"></span>   location where an email address can be found, that belongs to the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1430"></span>   organisation responsible for this grouping. Questions regarding the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1431"></span>   grouping should be sent to the indicated email address. The 'Group
<span class="anchor" id="line-1432"></span>   symbol' contains a value that associates the frame with this group
<span class="anchor" id="line-1433"></span>   throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are
<span class="anchor" id="line-1434"></span>   reserved. The 'Group symbol' may optionally be followed by some group
<span class="anchor" id="line-1435"></span>   specific data, e.g. a digital signature. There may be several "GRID"
<span class="anchor" id="line-1436"></span>   frames in a tag but only one containing the same symbol and only one
<span class="anchor" id="line-1437"></span>   containing the same owner identifier. The group symbol must be used
<span class="anchor" id="line-1438"></span>   somewhere in the tag. See the description of the frame grouping flag
<span class="anchor" id="line-1439"></span>   in the ID3v2 structure document [ID3v2-strct] for more information.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1450"></span>   that its program uses and does not fit into the other frames. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1451"></span>   frame consists of an 'Owner identifier' string and the binary data.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1452"></span>   The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
<span class="anchor" id="line-1453"></span>   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
<span class="anchor" id="line-1454"></span>   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible

<span class="anchor" id="line-1466"></span>   This frame enables a group of frames, grouped with the 'Group
<span class="anchor" id="line-1467"></span>   identification registration', to be signed. Although signatures can
<span class="anchor" id="line-1468"></span>   reside inside the registration frame, it might be desired to store
<span class="anchor" id="line-1469"></span>   the signature elsewhere, e.g. in watermarks. There may be more than
<span class="anchor" id="line-1470"></span>   one 'signature frame' in a tag, but no two may be identical.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1489"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1490"></span>   Audio files with variable bit rates are intrinsically difficult to
<span class="anchor" id="line-1491"></span>   deal with in the case of seeking within the file. The ASPI frame
<span class="anchor" id="line-1492"></span>   makes seeking easier by providing a list a seek points within the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1493"></span>   audio file. The seek points are a fractional offset within the audio
<span class="anchor" id="line-1494"></span>   data, providing a starting point from which to find an appropriate
<span class="anchor" id="line-1495"></span>   point to start decoding. The presence of an ASPI frame requires the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1496"></span>   existence of a TLEN frame, indicating the duration of the file in
<span class="anchor" id="line-1497"></span>   milliseconds. There may only be one 'audio seek point index' frame in
<span class="anchor" id="line-1498"></span>   a tag.

<span class="anchor" id="line-1507"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1508"></span>     Fraction at index (Fi)          $xx (xx)
<span class="anchor" id="line-1509"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1510"></span>   'Indexed data start' is a byte offset from the beginning of the file.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1511"></span>   'Indexed data length' is the byte length of the audio data being
<span class="anchor" id="line-1512"></span>   indexed. 'Number of index points' is the number of index points, as
<span class="anchor" id="line-1513"></span>   the name implies. The recommended number is 100. 'Bits per index
<span class="anchor" id="line-1514"></span>   point' is 8 or 16, depending on the chosen precision. 8 bits works
<span class="anchor" id="line-1515"></span>   well for short files (less than 5 minutes of audio), while 16 bits is
<span class="anchor" id="line-1516"></span>   advantageous for long files. 'Fraction at index' is the numerator of
<span class="anchor" id="line-1517"></span>   the fraction representing a relative position in the data. The
<span class="anchor" id="line-1518"></span>   denominator is 2 to the power of b.
<span class="anchor" id="line-1519"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1520"></span>   Here are the algorithms to be used in the calculation. The known data
<span class="anchor" id="line-1521"></span>   must be the offset of the start of the indexed data (S), the offset
<span class="anchor" id="line-1522"></span>   of the end of the indexed data (E), the number of index points (N),
<span class="anchor" id="line-1523"></span>   the offset at index i (Oi). We calculate the fraction at index i
<span class="anchor" id="line-1524"></span>   (Fi).
<span class="anchor" id="line-1525"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1526"></span>   Oi is the offset of the frame whose start is soonest after the point
<span class="anchor" id="line-1527"></span>   for which the time offset is (i/N * duration).
<span class="anchor" id="line-1528"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1529"></span>   The frame data should be calculated as follows:
<span class="anchor" id="line-1530"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1531"></span>     Fi = Oi/L * 2^b    (rounded down to the nearest integer)
<span class="anchor" id="line-1532"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1533"></span>   Offset calculation should be calculated as follows from data in the
<span class="anchor" id="line-1534"></span>   frame:
<span class="anchor" id="line-1535"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-1536"></span>     Oi = (Fi/2^b)*L    (rounded up to the nearest integer)
